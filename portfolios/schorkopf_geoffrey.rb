  :looking_for => "I am looking for a startup or consultancy atmosphere of small/medium size in the Atlanta area. An ideal company would value open source work and community contribution, as well as continue to challenge and expand my programming knowledge. I strongly prefer a company culture that values project candidness, frequent pairing sessions, and test-driven development. I would love the opportunity to work with both the backend in Ruby and frontend in JavaScript, and generally be able to regularly express my understanding of the full stack. I expect the company regularly contributes to local Ruby meetups, participates and sends speakers to local/national conferences, and in general has employees that respect a regular workweek and have fun after hours (whether that be hackathons, going out to see theater/live music, or enjoying happy hours).",
